# matplotlib_challenge
Homework number 5 for matplot lib
This assignment seeks to demonstrate skills for data merging, data cleaning, interigating data as well
as using both python and matplotlib to vizualize analysis.

After completing the various analysis I had the following analysis and conclusion:

The linear regression has an r squared of about .43 which indicates that mouse weight and tumor volume were not closesly related.  This doesn't say much about the tumor as there are a number of other factors that have to do with mouse weight.

The Capomulin and Ramicane, per bar chart, have more timepoints than the others.  They also had lower sem than the other ragimes (perhaps because they had more timepoints (larger sample size).

The box plot reflect this with Capomulin and Ramicane both showing a narrower box than the other plots in the box.  Both drugs were represented in the lower part box indicating that they were assiciated with lower tumor volume also. The boxplot also didn't show any outliers which agrees with the IQR analysis.  

Without any more information, if my mouse was sick, I'd use the Capomulin or Ramicane.
